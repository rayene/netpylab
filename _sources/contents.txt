NetPyLab v0.7 documentation
===========================

.. note::
    NetPyLab is still an early alpha. It is still bogus and may not 
    work properly on all the platforms (e.g., M$ Windows). In addition, the 
    API is subject to change without prior notification.
    Download and use if you are fearless and want to have a look or if you 
    are a Python coder and want a to help us fix some bad bad bugs !
